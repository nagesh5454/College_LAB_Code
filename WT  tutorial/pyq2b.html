Yes, merging rows and columns can be used together in HTML tables to create more complex layouts. This is achieved using the rowspan and colspan attributes.

The rowspan attribute specifies the number of rows a cell should span, while the colspan attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of merging rows and columns:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Merging Rows and Columns</title>
    <style>
        table {
            border-collapse: collapse;
        }
        
        th, td {
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 8px;
            text-align: center;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th rowspan="2">Header 1</th>
            <th colspan="2">Header 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Subheader 1</th>
            <th>Subheader 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 1, Cell 1</td>
            <td>Row 1, Cell 2</td>
            <td>Row 1, Cell 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Row 2, Cell 1</td>
            <td colspan="2">Row 2, Cell 2 and 3 (merged)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
In this example, we have a table with four rows and three columns. Here's what each part of the table does:

The first row has a header cell (Header 1) that spans two rows (rowspan="2"), and two header cells (Header 2 and Subheader 2) that span two columns (colspan="2").

The second row has two cells (Subheader 1 and Subheader 2) that occupy one column each.

The third row has three cells (Row 1, Cell 1, Row 1, Cell 2, and Row 1, Cell 3) with regular spanning.

The fourth row has a cell (Row 2, Cell 1) with regular spanning and a cell (Row 2, Cell 2 and 3) that spans two columns (colspan="2"), effectively merging the cells.

When you view the HTML code in a web browser, you will see a table with merged rows and columns, creating a more complex layout with merged cells. Feel free to experiment with the code and adjust the rowspan and colspan attributes to achieve different merging effects in your tables.
