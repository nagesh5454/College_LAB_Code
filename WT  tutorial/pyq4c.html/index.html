<!-- In this example:

The HTML form contains an input field for the user to enter their name and a submit button.
The form's action attribute is set to "display_name.php", which means the form data will be sent to the PHP file for processing.
The PHP file checks if the request method is POST (to handle the form submission) and retrieves the user name from the $_POST superglobal array.
The PHP file uses the echo statement to display a greeting message with the user's name.
When you open the HTML file in a web browser, you'll see the form. After entering a name and submitting the form, the PHP file will process the form data and display a greeting message with the entered name.

Please make sure that the PHP file has a .php extension and is correctly configured on a server that supports PHP processing.
