// Aim:  
// To write simple Shell Programs by using conditional, branching and looping 
// statements. 
 

// Program 1. Shell script to check given number even or odd  
// Program 2. Shell Script to check given year leap year or not. 
// Program 3. Shell Script to calculate factorial of given number. 
// Program 4. Shell Script to swap two integers. 
 
 
 
// Conclusion:  
//          Thus, we have successfully studied and executed shell script.
